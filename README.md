# Dynamic Dashboard (React + Vite + Zustand)

This project demonstrates a dynamic dashboard where users can:
- Add widgets (name + text) to a category
- Remove widgets via a cross icon on each widget
- Use a sidebar to check/uncheck widgets per category
- Search across all widgets
- State is managed locally using Zustand
